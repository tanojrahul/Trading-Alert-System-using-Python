# Nifty 50 Trading Bot

This Python script monitors the Nifty 50 index in real-time using the Alpha Vantage API. It calculates moving average crossovers and sends trading alerts via WhatsApp using the Twilio API.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data**: Fetches live candlestick data for the Nifty 50 index every minute.
- **Moving Average Crossover**: Calculates short and long-term moving averages to determine BUY or SELL signals.
- **WhatsApp Notifications**: Sends real-time trading alerts directly to your WhatsApp.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Alpha Vantage API Key
- Twilio Account (for WhatsApp messaging)

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nifty50-trading-bot.git
   cd nifty50-trading-bot
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**
   ```bash
   pip install requests twilio
   ```

3. **Set Your Credentials and Parameters**

   - Replace `'YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY'` with your Alpha Vantage API key.
   - Replace `'YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID'`, `'YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN'`, `'YOUR_TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER'`, and `'RECIPIENT_PHONE_NUMBER'` with your Twilio account SID, authentication token, Twilio sandbox number, and recipient's WhatsApp number respectively.

## Usage

Simply run the script to start monitoring the Nifty 50 index and receiving trading alerts:
```bash
python main.py
```

## How It Works

1. **Fetch Data**: The script fetches live candlestick data for the Nifty 50 index at 1-minute intervals from Alpha Vantage.
2. **Calculate Moving Averages**: It calculates the short-term and long-term moving averages based on the closing prices.
3. **Check for Crossover**: The script checks if a moving average crossover has occurred:
   - **BUY Signal**: If the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average.
   - **SELL Signal**: If the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.
4. **Send Alerts**: If a BUY or SELL signal is detected, a WhatsApp message is sent using the Twilio API with the details of the signal.

## Example Output

The WhatsApp message will look like this:
```
ðŸš¨ Trading Alert ðŸš¨
Symbol: NIFTY50
Action: BUY
Timeframe: 1min
Details: Moving average crossover detected.
```
